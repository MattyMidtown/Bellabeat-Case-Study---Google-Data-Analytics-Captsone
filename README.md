# Bellabeat-Case-Study---Google-Data-Analytics-Captsone
Case study done as part of the Google Analytics program's culminating assignment. The premise of the case is that Bellabeat, a company that makes wearable smart tech for women, wants to be a bigger player in the smart device game. To help them, I analyzed real Fitbit biometric tracker data (provided to us) to find key insights that would inform Bellabeat's overall marketing strategy. For this project, I used R, a tool that I was previously familiar with, but felt I needed improvement in. I used R to advance my skill with the language, which eventually payed off. With R, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data.
